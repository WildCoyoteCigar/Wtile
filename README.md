A dynamic tiling window manager for Windows.

Wtile's goal is a dwm-like tiling manager for Windows: as lightweight and as fast as the Win32 API
allows, with no compromise made purely for portability. It brings dynamic tiling, tags, and a
keyboard-driven workflow — the model popularized by [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/) on X11 and
proven viable on Win32 by [bug.n](https://github.com/fuhsjr00/bug.n) — to Windows 10/11. It's
written in C# on .NET with NativeAOT (a real native `.exe`, no runtime to install, no JIT warmup)
and talks to the OS directly through Win32 (via [CsWin32](https://github.com/microsoft/CsWin32),
not a cross-platform abstraction layer), built for environments where switching operating systems
isn't an option.

## Status

Actively developed, not yet a 1.0. Expect rough edges.

## Features

- **Dynamic tiling** with multiple layouts: master-stack (dwm's classic `[]=`, master column
  either side), monocle (`[M]`, one fullscreen window at a time), centered-master (`|M|`,
  centered single window), vertical-stack (`=`, full-width rows), deck (`[D]`, master tiles
  normally but stack windows overlap full-size behind each other), and dwindle (`[\]`, windows
  spiral inward, each one taking half of whatever space is left).
- **Tags, not virtual desktops** — dwm-style: each window belongs to a tag, tags are switched
  instantly, and each tag remembers its own layout, master count (`nmaster`), master/stack ratio
  (`mfact`), and gap independently.
- **Tag rules** (dwm's `rules[]`): map windows to a tag (and optionally a monitor) by process
  name, class, or title regex, so an app always opens on its own tag -- optionally switching the
  view there as it appears.
- **Multi-monitor**, dwm-style: each monitor gets its own tags and layout state off one shared
  config, with `focus-monitor`/`move-window-to-monitor` to move between them.
- **Status bar** per monitor: tags (with an occupancy indicator), current layout symbol, focused
  window title, clock — GDI+ rendered, click-to-switch-tag.
- **Global hotkeys** via a low-level keyboard hook, not `RegisterHotKey` — because Windows reserves
  most of the `Win+<key>` space for the shell, this actually works for bare `Win+letter` bindings
  the way dwm/bug.n users expect.
- **bug.n-style window pinning** (stay visible across every tag switch) and dwm-style "view all
  tags" (`view(~0)`).
- **dmenu-style app launcher** (`Win+Escape` by default): a fuzzy-filterable popup flush against
  the bar, listing PATH executables and Start Menu shortcuts — type to filter, arrow/Tab to pick,
  Enter to launch.
- **Fully configurable via YAML**, hot-reloadable with a single hotkey (no background file
  watcher — you press reload after editing, or after changing monitor setup).
- Optional **taskbar hiding** and **title-bar/border stripping** per window, for a cleaner,
  fully tiled look.
- Optional **session persistence** (`rememberState`): remembers which monitor/tag each window was
  on, plus its floating/pinned state, across quit/restart and "reload" — matched back to reopened
  windows by process name + window class.
- Optional **launch on boot**: a "Launch on boot" toggle in the tray icon's right-click menu (or
  `launchOnBoot` in config) registers Wtile in the per-user Run key so it starts with Windows.
  "Launch on boot as administrator" (`launchOnBootElevated`) starts it elevated through a
  scheduled task instead, so it can tile windows running as administrator.


## Download

Grab the latest build from [Releases](../../releases) — a self-contained `win-x64` executable,
no .NET runtime install required.

## Configuration

On first run, Wtile writes a commented default config to `%APPDATA%\Wtile\config.yaml`. See
[`docs/config.sample.yaml`](docs/config.sample.yaml) for the canonical, fully-documented example,
including a mapping of every binding back to its dwm/bug.n equivalent. After editing, press the
reload hotkey (`Win+Shift+R` by default) to apply changes — nothing is watched automatically.

## Building from source

Requires the .NET 10 SDK and the "Desktop development with C++" Visual Studio workload (needed by
NativeAOT's linker).

```powershell
dotnet build Wtile.slnx -c Release
dotnet test tests/Wtile.Tests/Wtile.Tests.csproj -c Release
dotnet publish src/Wtile/Wtile.csproj -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained
```

The published executable lands in `src/Wtile/bin/Release/net10.0-windows/win-x64/publish/`.
